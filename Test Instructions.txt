TEST INSTRUCTIONS

1. Run the provided movies-and-directors.sql in Workbench to create the database and necessary tables

2. Enter your connection details in the index.php

3. Review the routes.php file to understand which MVC parts you'll need
    3a. Complete the model for the director
    3b. Complete the model for the movie
    3c. Review the views for the director - (this is completed for you, but you will use these to determine info you need for your actions)
    3d. Review the views for the movie - (this is completed for you, but you will use these to determine info you need for your actions)
    3e. Complete the controller actions for the director
    3f. Complete the controller actions for the movie

4. Grading for this will work by visual review of each completed action:
    (10%) - Working CREATE: directors/new -> DirectorsController::create -> DirectorModel::create -> directors/index
    (10%) - Working CREATE: movies/new -> MoviesController::create -> MovieModel::create -> movies/index
    (10%) - Working UPDATE: directors/edit -> DirectorsController::update -> DirectorModel::update -> directors/index
    (10%) - Working UPDATE: movies/edit -> MoviesController::update -> MovieModel::update -> movies/index
    (10%) - Working INDEX: directors/index -> DirectorsController::index -> DirectorModel::findAll -> directors/index
    (10%) - Working INDEX: movies/index -> MoviesController::index -> MovieModel::findAll -> movies/index
    (10%) - Working DELETE: directors/delete -> DirectorsController::delete -> DirectorModel::delete -> directors/index
    (10%) - Working DELETE: movies/delete -> MoviesController::delete -> MovieModel::delete -> movies/index
    (5%)  - Submission uploaded to Github and repository link shared
    (15%) - Zero required effort from the instructor to troubleshoot issues

5. ENSURE YOUR CONTROLLERS HAVE VALIDATION IN THEM (failure to have validation means a create and edit action will lose 50% of the marks)
    
IMPORTANT NOTES:
    - IF a director can't be created, the movie will be considered incomplete and you will lose 50% of marks on all movie actions as a result
    - IF your final consists of a mess of copy & paste code that is irrelevant to the topic of the final, you will receive a zero
    - IF your final doesn't abide by the MVC principals learned over the last 5 weeks, you will receive a zero
    - IF you submit someone else's code or solution as your own, you, and that person, will receive a zero
